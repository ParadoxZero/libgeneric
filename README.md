## Contributing
Please contribute to it and help implement most of the common structures. 

The aim is to build a reusable standard datastructure library for different c-based projects. 

### Please keep in mind

- Please mark the option **Allow edits from maintainers**, so that we can improve your pull together.
  
- Mark an existing issue as `currently working` label.

- This project is adapting [Linux Kernel Coding Style][1]

- Try to make functions like `foo_bar()` instead of `fooBar()`

- Ensure it's stable. Write a test for each function you implement.

- Keep it generic. (use `void*`)
