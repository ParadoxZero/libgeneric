## Contributing
Please contribute to it and help implement most of the common structures. 

The aim is to build a reusable standard datastructure library for different c-based projects. 

### Please keep in mind

- Create an Issue before starting to implement anything. 
  
  This helps me know what you are working on, also we can get some discussion done.
  
- Mark an existing issue as `currently working` label.

- This project is adapting [Linux Kernel Coding Style][1]
- Ensure it's build-able. Write a test for each function you implement.

- Keep it generic. (use `void*`)
