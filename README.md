## Contributing

Please contribute to it and help implement most of the common structures.

The aim is to build a reusable standard datastructure library for different c-based projects.

### Please keep in mind

- Create an Issue before starting to implement anything.

  This helps me know what you are working on, also we can get some discussion done.

- Mark an existing issue as `currently working` label.

- There is no official style guide as of now. But please try to keep the code base coherent.

- Ensure it's build-able. Write a test for each function you implement.

- Keep it generic. (use `void*`)
